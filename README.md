ex1 
The program reads the number of participants and matrix representing the interactions of each participant at the event, similar to an adjacency matrix of an oriented graph, from a file. It then pushes n participants into a stack. 
It then saves the top of the stack as a current value to be checked uses two booleans to check if the participants meets the conditions to be homer (there are no cases where there is more than one homer since all of the other participants have talked to homer). It then exits the while loop if homer is found and if it doesnt exit the while loop and the stack becomes empty, it means that homer has skipped the event.

ex2 
The program reads the time of the orders and their duration from a file and then converts the time to minutes for each order so that it is easier to work with the specific times. (note, the durations are always imputed as minutes). it then meets all of the demanded requirements by storing them into queues and working with the orders naturally, as a normal queue at a restaurant. (additional comments can be found inside the code)

ex3 
The program uses structures and a template class to work with the polynomials more easily. It also includes the header list.h as the polynomials are stored in lists. then using functions it meets the the demanded requirements.
